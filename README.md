# MultiWindowPanel<br />
Panel App for Samsung Galaxy devices that support Edge.<br />
May only support Note Edge series.<br />
<br />
Launch Apps in Multi Window Mode from the Panel.<br />
<br />
A bit of a note: the proper way to check if an App supports multiwindow is to check the App's meta-data, any App that does not state<br />
support should load in normal fullscreen mode. The Strict mode shows only the Apps that announce they are multiwindow enabled.<br />
However.<br />
There are a bunch of Apps, mostly Google ones, that will load in multiwindow mode despite not annoucing they are multiwindow enabled.<br />
This appears to be something the Launcher in Samsung's ROM is deciding on its own to allow, I have not found any way to exploit this<br />
as of yet.<br />
If you turn off Strict mode these Apps can also be added to the Panel and launched in multiwindow mode.<br />
